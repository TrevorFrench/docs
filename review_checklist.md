Review checklist
================

JOSE reviews are checklist-driven. That is, there is a checklist for each JOSE reviewer to work through when completing their review. A JOSE review is generally considered incomplete until the reviewer has checked off all of their checkboxes.

Below is an example of the review checklist.
